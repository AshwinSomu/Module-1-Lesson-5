                A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen
                due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely random
                paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers' block in the
                first place.

                    Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with
                    the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing
                    started so that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.
